1. Dual-boot of Manjaro/Linux + Windows
2. downgrade/download from Internet Archives MESA and libglvnd; ignore these in pacman.conf
mesa-18.0.3-4-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
and
lib32-libglvnd-1.1.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
there's one  more package to downgrade, too

Install swig, and also install sdsl_mixer - these packages are needed but conda doesn't say they are.

Then install the conda environment using the environment file.
Use (only?) the Miniconda3-4.7.12-Linux-x86_64.sh installer, otherwise the environment file doesn't make sense to conda anymore


# I'd suggest to use the environment .yml file, otherwise... getting pygame to work, or pyo to work, is espacially hard. wxpython also gives troubles
